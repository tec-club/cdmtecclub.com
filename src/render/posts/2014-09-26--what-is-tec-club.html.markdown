TEC Club &mdash;or the club of Technology, Entrepreneurship and Coding&mdash; is a club at the Corona del Mar High School campus that exists to foster an interest in the latest fields and prepare students for STEM jobs. The TEC Club was founded in order to provide a place of connection for those interested in the rapidly evolving technology industry. Membership spans grade levels and is encouraged for coding/business beginners to coding/business expert.

Workshops are scheduled up to 3 times a week and provide curious students with the opportunity to introduce themselves to college and industry level programming concepts. Workshops are focused around stimulating interest in the subject, directing students on pathways worth pursuing, and answering questions that are best done in person instead of online. You can find previous workshops at [TEC Club: Workshops](/workshops/).

We also provide a venue and forum for guest and member speakers. This provides an opportunity for TEC Club members to share their knowledge in a formal, professional-feeling way.
