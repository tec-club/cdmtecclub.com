We will be preparing our development environments for JavaScript development. Our main IDE will be Sublime Text 3 and we will use Python as our webserver and possibly future backend.

### Step 1: Install ST3

Browse to [http://www.sublimetext.com/3][st3] and download the version that is appropriate for your operating system.

Next, install Sublime Text 3 and open it up.

### Step 2: Install ST3's Package Control

Navigate to [https://sublime.wbond.net/installation][package control]. Follow the instructions under the header 'Simple'.

### Step 3: Install Python

First, check if Python is already installed on your machine. Open up a command prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) and type `python --version` then hit `enter`.

The output should read something similar to:
```
Python 2.7.6
```

If it doesn't, follow the directions at one of these links:

 * (OSX): [https://www.python.org/download/mac][python mac]
 * (Linux): [Installing Python on Linux][python linux]

### Step 4: Get Coding

Your environments setup! Soon we'll learn how to use it :)
